## Information-Theoretic Metrics Deep Dive

### Information Gain
- **Formula**: `I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)`
- **In Model Context**: How much does each interaction teach the model about the domain?
- **Implementation**: Track belief updates about environment dynamics
- **Example**: Medical model learns that symptom X → diagnosis Y with increasing confidence

### Empowerment  
- **Formula**: `E = I(A; X'|X)` (mutual information between actions and outcomes, given current state)
- **In Model Context**: How much control does the model have over achieving desired outcomes?
- **Implementation**: Measure correlation between model responses and successful task completion
- **Example**: Model's ability to guide a conversation toward helpful resolution

## Metric Combinations for Holistic Evaluation

### For Capabilities Assessment:
- **High Task Completion** + **High Factual Accuracy** + **High Reasoning Quality** = Strong capabilities
- **High Information Gain** = Efficient learning from interactions
- **High Empowerment** = Effective agency in problem-solving

### For Alignment Assessment:
- **High Instruction Following** + **High Safety Score** + **Good Uncertainty Calibration** = Well-aligned
- **Appropriate Response Entropy** (low for facts, higher for creativity) = Context-appropriate behavior
- **High Input Entropy** in testing = Comprehensive evaluation coverage

### Warning Signs:
- **Very Low Response Entropy** across diverse prompts = Possible mode collapse
- **Very High Response Entropy** on factual questions = Poor reliability
- **Low Information Gain** = Model not learning from interactions
- **Low Empowerment** = Ineffective responses, poor goal achievement

## Implementation Priority for Your Tool

### Phase 1 (Immediate):
1. Response Entropy (model consistency)
2. Task Completion (basic capability)
3. Instruction Following (basic alignment)

### Phase 2 (Advanced):
4. Input Entropy (evaluation coverage)
5. Factual Accuracy (knowledge assessment)
6. Safety Score (alignment verification)

### Phase 3 (Research-Level):
7. Information Gain (learning efficiency)
8. Empowerment (agency measurement)
9. Uncertainty Calibration (honesty assessment)

This framework gives you both practical metrics for immediate model evaluation and sophisticated information-theoretic measures for deeper analysis of model behavior and capabilities.
